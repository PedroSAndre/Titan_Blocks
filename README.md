# Titan Blocks
Production of a small and basic game inspired by the popular game tetris, called Titan Blocks, in order to increase my knowledge of python and UI/gaming programing in general when I was starting by bachelors degree. In its current state the game is very crude and featureless, since it was made in about 4 hours of effective codding, but it works.

## Instructions to Run
Needs to have dependency pygame installed, using "pip install pygame".
Runs with python using command: "python main.py".

## Instructions to Play
Pieces move using the arrow keys. Rotate using the space key.
